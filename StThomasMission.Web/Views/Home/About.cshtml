                    <p>
                        Founded in 2005, St. Thomas Mission has grown from a small parish to a cornerstone of the Wythenshawe community. Over the years, we have expanded our programs to include catechism classes, community events, and outreach initiatives, all rooted in our commitment to faith and fellowship.

                        We envision a community where every individual is empowered to live out their faith through active participation, lifelong learning, and service to others. Join us as we continue to build a welcoming and inclusive environment for all.
